This repository contains the code used for the project for the 2025 course of Deep Natural Language Processing for the group "Plumbers".
We leave the outputs generated by the code in the Colab Notebooks, so that they can be verified without running the code, if desired.

# Content

## models
This folder contains the models we used and/or fine-tuned, in order to avoid re-training or re-finetuning the models every time.

## notebooks
This folder contains all the .ipynb files used to develop the project. Inside the folder there are the general files like the one used for the evaluation of the hyperparameters. The folders "First-extension" and "Second-extension" contain the file used to work on the extensions for the base model.
